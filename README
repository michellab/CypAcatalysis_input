CypAcatalysis_input
-------------------

Contains all input file for the publication on the topic of "Allosteric effects in cyclophilin mutants may be explained by changes in nano-microsecond time scale motions".

Link to publication will appear here shortly. 

- MDEnzyme+nosub contains the input files for 200-ns MD simulation free wild type(WT) and mutants (ST, STCS, STCSIV)

- Umbrella sampling contains the input file for umbrella sampling simulation of 'in' and 'out' conformations of CypA complexed (
AAPF in water, WT+AAPF, ST+AAPF, STCS+AAPF, STCSIV+AAPF )

- MSM Analysis contains three jupyter notebooks:

  01_getting_dihedrals.ipynb for reading trajectory files and compute the dihedral trajectories of the selected side chain amino acids in the active site.

  02_Clustering.ipynb for reading the dihedral trajectories and clustering these input data to genterate discrete trajectories
 
dihedral trajectories and a jupyter notebook for the active site side chain MSM analysis. 
  03_MSM_ALL_analysis.ipynb for reading the input discrete trajectories and computing the Bayesian MSM analysis.
